# Workday Scheduler

## Purpose
A website that was created to assist user in managing their daily tasks. Upon page load, it will load any already saved tasks for the current date.

User can also see if tasks are in the past (color coded gray), present(color coded red), or future (color coded green) so they can properly plan and prioritze their tasks for the day.
